# Refactorator II, The App

This is the source for the App version of the [Refactorator plugin](https://github.com/johnno1962/Refactorator)
for refactoring Swift (well, renaming actually.)

One of the features of app is it can convert a project into a standalone website of navigable code for
example [this project](http://johnholdsworth.com/refactorator).

To build, clone this and the code for the Refactorator plugin next to each other the build this project.
Help is available (here)[http://johnholdsworth.com/refactorator.html] where you can download a pre-built
binary.

This project is an experiment in "Beerware". I'd like to forward the idea that it would be great if
all software was Open Source that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be free!
